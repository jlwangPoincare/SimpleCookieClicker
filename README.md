# A simple demo of cookie clicker game in Javascript
I used to play the game "Cookie Clicker" for a while (who didn't?),
now, eventually, I am able to make a similar one with Javascript.

## Current status
At this time, it is only a demo with one "click" button and one "buy a clicker"
button. But Other features in the game logic are not hard to implement with my
current framework. If someone is interested, I will make it better on my own.

## Play the game
